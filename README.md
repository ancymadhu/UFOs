# UFOs

## Project Overview

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Resources

* Languages Used: Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Results

The website allow users to filter data for multiple criteria at the same time. The screen shot below shows the filter search button:

The options chosen by the user will take the values in data.js as reference and provide the results. The values in data.js are as shown below.

Once the values are given the table gives the specific filtered search output.
